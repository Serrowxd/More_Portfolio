I'm making another portfolio, because the last one is outdated.

This one will be a lot more simplistic, featuring ThreeJS paired with React and SASS to showcase my design concepts as well as my code.

Scripts:

- `npm run scss` starts the scss watch process
- `npm start` creates a local process for the project
